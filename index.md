## About

I am currently a masters student in Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Bombay with specialisation in Control and Computing. I work as a Project Research Assistant under Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri in Vision and Image Processing Lab.  
My research interests include incremental learning, co-segmentation, few-shot/zero-shot learning and computer vision. My work basically focuses on the problems like catastrophic forgetting faced by deep learning networks in realtime situations and development of different strategies to counter such issues.

## Research Experience
### CIRES-NET: Curriculum-driven Incremental learning Network for Remote Sensing Image Clas-sification  &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; (May ’19 - May ’20)&nbsp;
Guide: Prof.  Subhasis Chaudhuri, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay&nbsp;<br/>
* A faster and better performing continual learning technique for remote sensing image classification.
* Approach utilised curriculum learning to speed up the training time and also improve the result.
* Achieved about __19% margin__ above the closest performing existing algorithm on NWPU-RESISC45 dataset.
* Proposed approach was about __two times faster__ than the baseline algorithm
