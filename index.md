## About

Currently a final year masters student in Electrical Engineering Department at IIT Bombay with specialisation in Control and Computing. I work as a Project Research Assistant under <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/" target="_blank">Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri</a> in <a href="http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viplab/" target="_blank">Vision and Image Processing Lab</a>.  
My research interests include incremental learning, co-segmentation, few-shot/zero-shot learning and computer vision.

## Research Experience
### CIRES-NET: Curriculum-driven Incremental learning Network for Remote Sensing Image Classification 
Guide: <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/" target="_blank">Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri</a>, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay&nbsp;<br/>
Co-Guide: <a href="https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Biplab Banerjee</a>, CSRE, IIT Bombay&nbsp;<br/>
* A faster and better performing continual learning technique for remote sensing image classification.
* Approach utilised curriculum learning to speed up the training time and also improve the result.
* Achieved about __19% margin__ above the closest performing existing algorithm on NWPU-RESISC45 dataset.
* Proposed approach was about __two times faster__ than the baseline algorithm

### Directed Variational Cross-encoder Network for Few-shot Multi-image Co-segmentation
Guide:<a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sc/" target="_blank">Prof. Subhasis Chaudhuri</a>, Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay&nbsp;<br/>
* Designed a novel framework for multi image co-segmentation.
* Solves small sample problem in co-segmentation using few-shot learning approach.
* Achieved a margin of about 5% above existing state of the art techniques.
